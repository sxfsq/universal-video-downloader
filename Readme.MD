# Vimeo Downloader Web UI

A self-hosted, portable, and powerful web interface for downloading public and private Vimeo videos. This tool uses a self-contained version of FFmpeg to capture HLS streams and VODs, providing a user-friendly way to manage, organize, and customize batch downloads without touching the command line.

## ðŸŽ‰ Features

*   **Fully Portable:** No need to install FFmpeg yourself! The correct version is automatically downloaded when you run the startup script, making the application self-contained.
*   **Advanced Download Formats:** For each batch, you can choose to download:
    *   Video + Audio (Standard `.mp4`)
    *   Video Only (`.mp4`)
    *   Audio Only as an `.mp3` (Re-encoded for maximum compatibility)
    *   Audio Only as an `.m4a` (Copied directly for maximum speed)
*   **Smart Filenaming:** Videos downloaded with no audio are automatically given a `_No_Audio` suffix for easy identification.
*   **Process Control:**
    *   **Cancel Button:** Immediately stop the entire download queue at any time.
    *   **Collapsible Logs:** Keep the interface clean by showing or hiding the detailed logs with a single click.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    *   **Multi-URL Paste:** Paste an entire list of URLs at once, and the app will create the input fields for you.
    *   **Private/Public Toggle:** Easily switch between modes for downloading public videos or domain-protected private videos.
*   **Batch Organization:**
    *   Organize downloads into sections that run sequentially.
    *   Apply custom filename prefixes (e.g., `01.1_`, `01.2_`, then `02.1_`) for perfect course organization.
*   **Real-Time Progress:** Live progress bars, download speed (Mbps), file size, and detailed logs are displayed in the browser.

## âœ… Prerequisites

All you need is **Node.js** installed on the machine that will run the server.
*   Version 18.x or later is recommended.
*   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

*(You do **not** need to install FFmpeg yourself.)*

## ðŸ“– How to Use the Interface

The interface is organized into **Sections**. Each section is a batch that will run one after the other.

1.  **Configure a Section:**
    *   **Download Type:** Use the toggle to switch between **Private** (for domain-protected videos) and **Public**.
    *   **Filename Prefixes:** Set the **Major** (`01`, `02`, etc.) and starting **Minor** (`1`, `2`, etc.) numbers for your files.
    *   **Domain (for Private videos):** Enter the **Default Domain** where the private videos are embedded (e.g., `https://www.my-private-course.com`). You can also override this for individual videos.
    *   **Download Format:** Choose your desired output from the dropdown (Video+Audio, Video Only, MP3, or M4A).

2.  **Add Video URLs:**
    *   Paste a single Vimeo URL into the input field.
    *   **To paste a list:** Copy a list of URLs from a text file and paste it into any URL input. The app will automatically create new rows for you.
    *   Use the **"+ Add Video URL"** button to add more rows manually.

3.  **Manage Sections:**
    *   Click **"+ Add Another Section"** to create a new, independent batch.
    *   Click **"Remove Section"** to delete an entire section.

5.  **Find Your Files:**
    *   All successfully downloaded files will be saved in the `downloads` folder, which is created automatically in the project's root directory.
